        <p>Rock-paper-scissors (also known as scissors-paper-rock) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which
            each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed
            fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming
            a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (aka "victory" or "peace sign") except that it is pointed
            horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible
            outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play rock will beat
            another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper
            covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose
            the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.</p>
